# Virtual Reality Neonatal Intubation Model

A VR Neonatal Intubation Model for the I4H 2019 Health Hack Competition. Built in Unity for Oculus Rift/Rift S.
Special thanks to Sean Dunlop and Ryan Friesen from Lakehead University who generously provided us with the original baby model 
and the hospital assets, which were slightly modified for this project. 

## How do I run this project? 
This project can only run with Oculus Rift/Rift S, allowing the user to properly see and interact with the simulation. 

Note: The simulation was does **not** work with the Oculus Quest.

1. Download Unity Version 2019.2.13f1.
2. Install the [Android Tools SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/). 
3. Install [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022)
from the Asset Store.
4. Connect your Oculus device to your PC and turn developer mode **on** in Settings.
5. In Unity's Player Settings, check 'Virtual Reality Supported'. This enables VR support in Unity for the downloaded packages. 
6. With the Oculus headset on, click the 'Play' button at the top of the Unity editor. This will launch the simulation.
