# Virtual Reality Neonatal Intubation Model

A VR Neonatal Intubation Model for the I4H 2019 Health Hack Competition. Built in Unity for Oculus Rift/Rift S. 
Special thanks to Sean Dunlop and Ryan Friesen from Lakehead University who generously provided us with the original baby model 
and the hospital assets, which were slightly modified for this project.
